## Project Overview
This project is a pixel-perfect replica of [Khan Academy's](https://www.khanacademy.org/) home page, created for the Pixel Plus hackathon using Windsurf deployment technology. The goal was to recreate the Khan Academy website with high fidelity while adding a custom feature to enhance the learning experience.

## Features

### Core Features
- Pixel-perfect reproduction of Khan Academy's home page
- Identical visual elements including fonts, spacing, colors, and layout
- Responsive design matching the original site
- Mock data implementation to simulate the look and feel of the original site

### Custom Enhancement
**Floating Quiz Chatbot**: A unique feature added to the replica that helps evaluate a user's proficiency in any given subject. The chatbot:
- Provides interactive quizzes based on the subject area
- Evaluates user knowledge through adaptive questioning
- Offers personalized feedback and recommendations for improvement
- Floats on the page for easy access while browsing content

## Technical Implementation
- Single HTML implementation containing all necessary code
- Client-side only (no backend requirements)
- CSS styling to match Khan Academy's design system
- JavaScript for interactive elements and the custom quiz chatbot

## Development & Deployment
This project is built using Windsurf and deployed using github pages.

## Purpose
This replica serves as a demonstration of frontend development skills, with a focus on attention to detail in visual reproduction while adding value through the custom quiz chatbot functionality.

## Hackathon Constraints
- All code must be contained in a single HTML file
- No backend services required
- Must match the original site as closely as possible in terms of visual elements
